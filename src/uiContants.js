export const ABOUT_ME_TEXT =`I’m an MCA postgraduate with a strong academic background in computer applications, complemented by a BCA degree. My interest in technology has been consistent throughout my academic journey, where I explored software development through hands-on projects, coursework, and continuous self-learning. This passion laid a strong foundation in programming and web development.
I recently completed a 7-month internship as a Trainee Software Engineer at Haptiq Lab Pvt. Ltd. During this time, I worked on a live project called XYZ, where I contributed to the frontend using HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I also gained valuable exposure to backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB. This experience enhanced my practical understanding of full stack development and deepened my skills in building responsive and user-friendly web applications. Alongside, I’ve developed proficiency in Java, MySQL, Git, and GitHub through academic and personal projects.`;
